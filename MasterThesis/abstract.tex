This thesis addresses the issue of semantic representation of the deployment environment of a smart contract and the integration of semantic licensing from the Data Licenses Clearance Center (DALICC) library. This research is divided into four sections for the following reasons: First, we concentrated on how smart contracts develop on the blockchain and some additional information about this system. Second, we show how blockchain and semantic web technology can work together. It focuses on several methods for indexing and running Ethereum blockchain smart contracts. The third segment, meanwhile, focuses on DALICC as a framework for identifying licensing conflicts and cutting down on the price of rights clearance. In the final piece, we created a DApp to describe a semantic model of these installations and connect semantic licensing with content using smart contracts.
