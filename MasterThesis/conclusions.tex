\chapter{Conclusion}
This work adds to the literature by merging semantic licensing from the DALICC library with smart contracts and a few unresolved difficulties, especially in light of the scant number of studies that combine blockchain with the semantic web.\\
 As the foundation of our work, we concentrated on two elements for this purpose: \\
One such example is the Ethereum platform, which was created and put into use to maintain the system's dependability, security, autonomy, and decentralization. 
The second is the Ethereum ontology, which in OWL formalizes the ideas and terminology of the Ethereum blockchain and describes Ethereum objects as classes. Blocks, accounts, transactions, contract messages, and the connections between the instances of these classes are only a few of the key blockchain ideas covered.
As a result, leveraging Ethereum ontology concepts, a licensing system has been developed that preserves the integrity of license information and offers a semantic perspective of such a deployment environment.\\ 
The user is directed step-by-step through the licensing process to begin and receive their license receipt. \\
This DApp has certain restrictions as well, although most of them have solutions. Thus, in this work, we have created the fundamental techniques for the license attachment to data as well as a semantic mapping for the receipt that is the end product of this attachment procedure.
